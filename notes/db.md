## New Database Notes

- tblOccupants is a bit crowded - split up some of that info
    - split off NOK, employment, payment info to their own tables
    - apt phone isn't necessary, just add "phone" field for tenant phone number
- tblDay Due and tblFrequency can be combined into one table of variables
- tbl After collections count can be expanded upon
- tables for water, gas entries per building
