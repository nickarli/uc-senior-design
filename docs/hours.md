As the sole team member working on this project, I contributed 100% of the work to it, including:
- Assignments (Presentations, task list, milestones, timeline, etc.)
- Technical research
- Userbase research (What features are wanted? What should be left out?)
- Programming

During the first semester, I elected to primarily focus on the meta-side of the project, including assignments and analysis, plans, etc. The "meat" of the project work came in the second semester when I began developing for it. The MySQL database design came first before any programming occurred. The GUI aspect of the project came last, and it took the most time (~40 hours total with much more to come).
